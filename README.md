## Hello! ^.^

I'm 19 y.o and a very anxious person. Also idk how to do this github thingy so bear with me.

#### C + H on pony town is ALWAYS welcomed and encouraged, I love it :)

I'm mostly offtab unless a talk is going on. So the best way to communicate with me is either whispering or sitting close.

I love leaving little drawings in strawpages when I sit with someone. Sometimes, I send more than one. If it ever gets annoying, don't be discouraged to tell me to stop ^.^

I don't have a big DNI. Just don't be weird (basic DNI criteria), don't talk to me if you break CCs boundaries [yes simping also counts(I do check y'all's strawpages)].

Not exactly DNI but if you're younger than 14, I will not add you friend. Yet talking is fine, as long as it's respectful ^.^
